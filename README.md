Realtime/WebSocket support [has been requested](https://community.redwoodjs.com/t/how-would-you-implement-realtime-websockets-in-redwoodjs/644) since forever\*. For most people, using something like [https://pusher.com/channels](https://pusher.com/channels) or [https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime](https://supabase.com/docs/guides/realtime) is the best choice. But I wanted to see if I could roll my own. (\*beginning of 2020 ðŸ˜„)

I decided to build a simple multiplayer card game that would use WebSockets to sync the game state for all players (what cards they have on hand, what cards they've played etc). That's what you can see in the screen shot at the top of the page.

This blog post will show you how I set it up. But to keep it simple I'll just focus on a tiny part of the game: the score. If you look at the screenshot above you can see a score next to each player's name. I kept it super basic by just syncing all of the text inputs. You can just write whatever number you want in any of them and it'll sync to all players.

So this is what we'll build in this blog post:

A simple input box that is synced between all connected clients.

Create a new Redwood project `yarn create redwood-app --ts --git rw-ws-score`

Redwood uses Fastify for its API side web server. To get it to understand WebSockets we need to install a plugin: `yarn workspace api add @fastify/websocket`

That's all we have to do as far as setup goes. Now let's write some code! This is where it really shows that Redwood wasn't designed for realtime or WebSocket support â€“ we'll be writing all of the ws code on the api side in what is basically just meant to be a configuration file. But if you want ws support let us (the RW core team) know, and if there's enough demand we'll try to make the experience better!

Open up `api/server.config.js` and register the ws plugin.

```javascript
const configureFastify = async (fastify, options) => {
  if (options.side === 'api') {
    fastify.log.info({ custom: { options } }, 'Configuring api side')

    fastify.register(require('@fastify/websocket'))
  }

  // ...
}
```

This lets Fastify know about WebSockets. Now we need to add a route that'll handle the ws traffic.

```javascript
const configureFastify = async (fastify, options) => {
  if (options.side === 'api') {
    fastify.log.info({ custom: { options } }, 'Configuring api side')

    fastify.register(require('@fastify/websocket'))

    fastify.register((fastify) => {
      fastify.get('/ws', { websocket: true }, (connection) => {
        connection.socket.on('message', (message) => {
          console.log(`/ws message: ${message}`)
        })

        connection.socket.on('close', () => {
          console.log('Client disconnected')
        })
      })
    })
  }

  // ...
}
```

Let's test our code! Run `yarn rw dev api` in a terminal to start just the api side. In another terminal you can run `npx -y wscat -c ws://localhost:8911/ws`. It should open a connection to your server and give you a prompt. Type something, like `hello world`, and you should see it printed in the terminal that's running the RW api server.

Do you see the messages you type echoed in the api server terminal? If you do: Congratulations! You have a WebSocket web server running! If you don't: Try adding some `console.log`s, then restart the api server and try again. If you still can't get it to work, create a post on [the RW forums](https://community.redwoodjs.com) and ping me there, we'll all do our best to help you.

Now that you've confirmed that the api side is working, let's add some code to the web side too. I'll over-engineer this a little bit for our simple example, just to give you a better foundation to stand on when you build this out with more functionality.

I'll put the websocket code in a React Context so that you can access it from anywhere in your app.

```typescript
// web/components/WsContext/WsContext.tsx

import { useCallback, useContext, useEffect, useRef, useState } from 'react'

interface WsContextProps {
  players: Record<string, number>
  setScore: (playerId: string, score: number) => void
}

const WsContext = React.createContext<WsContextProps | undefined>(undefined)

interface Props {
  children: React.ReactNode
}

const WsContextProvider: React.FC<Props> = ({ children }) => {
  const [players, setPlayers] = useState<Record<string, number>>({})

  const ws = useRef<WebSocket>()

  useEffect(() => {
    const socket = new WebSocket('ws://localhost:8911/ws')

    socket.onopen = (event) => {
      console.log('socket open', event)
    }
    socket.onclose = (event) => {
      console.log('socket close', event)
    }
    socket.onerror = (event) => {
      console.log('socket error', event)
    }
    socket.onmessage = (event) => {
      console.log('socket message', event.data)

      try {
        const players = JSON.parse(event.data)
        setPlayers(players)
      } catch (e) {
        console.error('JSON.parse error', e)
      }
    }

    ws.current = socket

    return () => {
      socket.close()
    }
  }, [])

  const setScore = useCallback((playerId: string, score: number) => {
    ws.current?.send(JSON.stringify({ playerId, score }))
  }, [])

  return (
    <WsContext.Provider value={{ players, setScore }}>
      {children}
    </WsContext.Provider>
  )
}

export function useWsContext() {
  const context = useContext(WsContext)

  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useWsContext must be used within a WsContextProvider')
  }

  return context
}

export default WsContextProvider
```

Basically what's going on here is I create a React Context with a `useEffect` that will only be called after the very first render thanks to its empty dependency array. The `useEffect` function sets up a new WebSocket connection to our api server, registers a bunch of callbacks and returns a clean up function that will close the web socket connection when the context unmounts. Notice that we use the `ws` protocol when we specify the server address. The main socket callback is `socket.onmessage` which will receive all the messages from the WebSocket server. The other callbacks are mainly there to show you what's available and to help you debug any errors you might run into. On the context you can access all players and their scores plus a method to update the score for a player. WebSockets can only communicate using text, that's why we use `JSON.stringify` before sending an updated score for a player. Finally there's a custom React hook to make it more convenient to use the context.

To make this context available to the entire app I place it in `App.tsx`

```typescript
const App = () => (
  <FatalErrorBoundary page={FatalErrorPage}>
    <RedwoodProvider titleTemplate="%PageTitle | %AppTitle">
      <RedwoodApolloProvider>
        <WsContextProvider>
          <Routes />
        </WsContextProvider>
      </RedwoodApolloProvider>
    </RedwoodProvider>
  </FatalErrorBoundary>
)
```

The final piece of the web-side puzzle is to actually use the context. Let's create a page for this.

```
yarn rw g page home /
```

Here's the base component code
```typescript
import { useState } from 'react'

import { useWsContext } from 'src/components/WsContext/WsContext'

const HomePage = () => {
  const [name, setName] = useState('')
  const [score, setScore] = useState(0)
  const ws = useWsContext()

  return (
    <>
      <label>
        Name:{' '}
        <input value={name} onChange={(event) => setName(event.target.value)} />
      </label>
      <br />
      <br />
      <label>
        Score:{' '}
        <input
          value={score}
          onChange={(event) => {
            const score = parseInt(event.target.value, 10)
            // Set the score in component state to make the input value update
            // immediately
            setScore(score)

            // Send to the server to update all clients (including this one)
            ws.setScore(name, score)
          }}
        />
      </label>
      <hr />
      <ul>
        {Object.entries(ws.players).map(([playerId, playerScore]) => (
          <li key={playerId}>
            {playerId}: {playerScore}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    </>
  )
}

export default HomePage
```

Unless you're super new with React the code should be pretty straight forward. A couple of input fields with state bound to them and then the context we created earlier is used to get a list of players to map over to display their names/ids and scores. The one thing that might look a little unusual is how we both keep our own score in the local `score` state as well as send it to the web socket using `ws.setScore`. But I hope the code comments are clear enough in describing what's going on and why I do it like that. With this code in place we can start the RW dev server again, but this time we start both sides `yarn rw dev`. Enter you name and a score and you should see something like `/ws message: {"playerId":"Tobbe","score":5}` in your dev server terminal output.

Now it's time to focus on the api side code again. It needs to keep track of all players and their scores, and broadcast it out to everyone.
